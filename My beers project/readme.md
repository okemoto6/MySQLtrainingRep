### Test project for BigQuery console maintain and query training.  
The main file for queries is My beers project/2.Queries.sql
Data in bjcp_guidelines table comes from [official BJCP site](https://www.bjcp.org/bjcp-style-guidelines/)  
Data in yeast table comes from each producer data sheets.  
Data in equipment and batches tables were generated by me and doesn't cover real data.
